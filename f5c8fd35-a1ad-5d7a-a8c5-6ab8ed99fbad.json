PM\n</document_metadata>\n\nv. In  storm  surge  prone  areas,  it  will  be  preferable  to  construct  the  community \nstructures,  like  schools,  cyclone  shelters,  etc.  by  raising  the  level  of  the  ground \nprotected  by  provision  of  retaining  walls  at  sufficient  distance  away  from  the \nbuilding,  taken  to  such  depth  that  no  erosion  takes  place  due  to  receding  storm \nsurge.  Alternatively,  construct  the  community  structures  on  stilts  with  no  masonry \nor bracing up to the probable maximum surge level. \nC. PROTECTION OF AREAS FROM FLOODS  \nThis may require one or more of the following actions. \ni. Construction  of  embankments  against  the  water  spills  from  the source  of  flooding \nlike rivers, large drain etc. \nii. Construction of high enough embankments/bund around the planning area. \niii. Raising the planning area above the high flood level. \niv. Construction/improvement of drainage paths to effectively drain the water from the \nplanning area."}},{"id":"dd1c1c54-be47-486c-aca9-ccad94967d69","values":[0.01707860268652439,-0.023395180702209473,-0.07152780890464783,-0.08475202322006226,0.08954493701457977,-0.016690906137228012,0.06668738275766373,0.07808929681777954,0.06245593726634979,-0.00867289025336504,0.06289127469062805,-0.02372422069311142,0.04464032128453255,-0.012384941801428795,-0.03727804869413376,0.04129301384091377,0.08408638089895248,-0.07840807735919952,-0.011423103511333466,-0.089045949280262,0.05597786232829094,-0.06068416312336922,-0.020740218460559845,0.01634545624256134,0.0526360385119915,0.029205361381173134,-0.040857281535863876,-0.01764243096113205,0.027910208329558372,-0.04159369692206383,-0.06264325231313705,-0.0074249254539608955,0.08019550144672394,-0.06645999103784561,0.039473969489336014,0.003847462357953191,-0.022915756329894066,-0.01178035233169794,0.08599714189767838,-0.061710696667432785,-0.030012382194399834,0.023986345157027245,0.0441158190369606,0.03496796637773514,0.006637497339397669,0.033194649964571,-0.05180290341377258,0.022245051339268684,-0.0027682718355208635,-0.01279574166983366,-0.030753454193472862,0.04126821085810661,0.05196911469101906,0.027881162241101265,0.07146018743515015,-0.005156085826456547,-0.045558054000139236,-0.006773374509066343,-0.05574885010719299,0.05811234191060066,0.04373569414019585,-0.052865684032440186,-0.01566167175769806,0.00658660801127553,0.06346579641103745,0.10535819828510284,0.03378182649612427,0.026616215705871582,-0.059234458953142166,-0.054931480437517166,-0.0743323564529419,0.07600380480289459,0.0001277450646739453,-0.041106414049863815,0.015968382358551025,0.010183148086071014,0.0435006283223629,-0.03805072233080864,0.04964246228337288,-0.07720909267663956,-0.05486385151743889,-0.046525683254003525,-0.044760894030332565,0.0518653504550457,-0.021412232890725136,0.0462903194129467,0.10698606818914413,-0.0469241589307785,0.05084794759750366,-0.07460512220859528,0.09786661714315414,0.018339069560170174,-0.09437140077352524,-0.04679420590400696,-0.03821561485528946,-0.03685440123081207,-0.0304886307567358,0.06509540230035782,0.08516795933246613,-0.05341305211186409,0.05756537988781929,-0.0166627187281847,0.04914155229926109,-0.0957895815372467,-0.04145486280322075,0.016404123976826668,0.019574247300624847,-0.10518905520439148,0.05897098407149315,-0.029895929619669914,-0.06938272714614868,0.008863112889230251,0.06686269491910934,0.032708656042814255,-0.043069854378700256,-0.06362303346395493,-0.03829307109117508,-0.06152084842324257,0.016555605456233025,-0.02330363355576992,0.07581595331430435,-0.021431071683764458,-0.046419404447078705,-0.05456549674272537,-0.0613529309630394,-0.05746367946267128,0.04913369566202164,0.026234257966279984,0.021697530522942543,0.0248532984405756,0.001578397466801107,0.06954652070999146,0.05322636291384697,0.028889521956443787,0.07914530485868454,0.06599239259958267,-0.08174072951078415,-0.017351165413856506,0.008480292744934559,-0.06211312860250473,-0.0158969946205616,0.06100801005959511,0.0164662953466177,0.0257851742208004,0.04843186214566231,0.08013837784528732,0.05590266361832619,-0.05597982183098793,0.09533442556858063,-0.026220494881272316,0.07030583173036575,-0.024529004469513893,0.03491676598787308,0.001824182691052556,0.07168813794851303,-0.08332576602697372,-0.07036517560482025,-0.025294749066233635,0.03826722130179405,0.07234319299459457,-0.03877190127968788,-0.03711342439055443,-0.08258127421140671,0.010774658992886543,-0.02268458716571331,-0.03224201872944832,0.05666690692305565,0.06339765340089798,-0.0305167343467474,-0.06900183111429214,-0.06449761986732483,0.045666202902793884,-0.033745452761650085,0.07853211462497711,-0.04690983146429062,0.025452708825469017,-0.04177561774849892,0.025247760117053986,0.011435013264417648,0.05372072756290436,-0.042675361037254333,-0.01172728557139635,-0.018748950213193893,-0.05069561302661896,-0.04361308738589287,-0.028053956106305122,-0.05515285208821297,-0.01015793439000845,0.015251780860126019,-0.04393775388598442,0.023998651653528214,0.06076729670166969,-0.05279877409338951,-0.06894338876008987,-0.058753885328769684,0.07408975809812546,-0.02564549632370472,0.04964200034737587,0.05180438607931137,0.04813031852245331,0.003997209947556257,0.012216000817716122,0.04425913840532303,0.07238831371068954,0.025729984045028687,0.005257945507764816,-0.01990843564271927,0.030742928385734558,-0.038337431848049164,0.06765566766262054,0.04029722884297371,-0.06547753512859344,-0.04819800332188606,0.048023633658885956,0.013470222242176533,-0.0058254096657037735,-0.006140375044196844,0.032322805374860764,-0.07591866701841354,-0.011618416756391525,0.05358055233955383,-0.05142842233181,0.056509584188461304,-0.0907563790678978,-0.04943818598985672,0.023204660043120384,0.027299771085381508,-0.043718207627534866,-0.02965850941836834,0.0023588023614138365,-0.04514021426439285,-0.06797154992818832,-0.07653649896383286,-0.062014419585466385,-0.04506726562976837,-0.06727255880832672,-0.023194974288344383,0.0338427
